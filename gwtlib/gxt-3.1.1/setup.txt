Quick Setup for Sencha GXT 3.1
==============================

Getting started online guide:
http://docs.sencha.com/gxt/3.1/getting_started/Getting_Started_31.html

Guides and Javadocs:
http://docs.sencha.com/gxt/3.1/


Note: GXT 3.1 requires GWT 2.6+.

STEP 1 -> Create a Google Web Application Project project within Eclipse.

STEP 2 -> Make the following changes to your host HTML page

2a. GXT 3.X requires a strict dtd. Add either of these as the first line in the host page:

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">

or

<!DOCTYPE html>

2b. Add a stylesheet link to reset.css and ensure it is the first referenced stylesheet:

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{module name}/reset.css" />

STEP 3 -> Add the following entry to your project's module xml file.

<inherits name='com.sencha.gxt.ui.GXT'/>

This inherits all GXT modules. As an alternative, individual GXT modules can be inherited rather than inheriting all modules,
but this is the easiest way to get started, and covers most of the default cases.

STEP 4 -> Eclipse Setup (should be similar for other development environments)
These instructions assume you have an existing project and launch configuration.

4a. Add gxt.jar to the project directly from the downloaded zip.
	a. Right click on project name in 'Package Explorer'.
	b. Select 'Properties' from the content menu.
	c. Select 'Java Build Path'.
	d. Select 'Libraries' tab.
	e. Add the gxt.jar either with 'Add JARs...' or 'Add External JARs...'.

4b. Add GXT jar to launch configuration.
	a. Choose Run / Open Run Dialog.
	b. Select your appropriate launch configuration under 'Java Application'.
	c. Select the 'Classpath' tab.
	d. Add the gxt.jar to the classpath under 'User Entries'.


If using Maven for project and dependency management, Sencha GXT artifacts are available in several ways. To get the commercially
licensed releases, you will need to add the following repository section to your pom.xml:
	
	<repository>
	  <id>sencha-commercial-release</id>
	  <name>Sencha commercial releases</name>
	  <url>https://maven.sencha.com/repo/commercial-release/</url>
	</repository>

For support releases, use the following repository instead, with your https://support.sencha.com credentials:

	<repository>
	  <id>sencha-commercial-support-release</id>
	  <name>Sencha commercial supprt releases</name>
	  <url>https://maven.sencha.com/repo/support-commercial-release/</url>
	</repository>

For GPLv3 licensed jars, you may use maven central.

There are several artifacts available:

  a. gxt-release - A zip of the release, similar to how GXT was released before 3.0
  b. gxt - The core component and data classes
  c. gxt-charts - The new drawing and charting API
  d. gxt-legacy - Classes to ease porting projects from earlier GXT versions
